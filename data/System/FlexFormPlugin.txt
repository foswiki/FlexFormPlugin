This plugin leverages the internal capabilities to render an interface for %SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms.
This API is part of the =Form= class of Foswiki and is called =renderForEdit()=. It takes
a form definition and creates an appropriate edit interface for the given !DataFrom. This
feature is actually very handy to write custom EDIT_TEMPLATEs and VIEW_TEMPLATEs in wiki applications.

The %<nop>RENDEFFOREDIT and %<nop>RENDERFORDISPLAY macros allows wiki application authors
to customize interfaces to !DataForms while not losing the flexibility of defining a !DataForm
in one place.

Imagine you created an EDIT_TEMPLATE _without_ %<nop>RENDERFOREDIT
by creating an HTML input form manually. When you decide to extend or modify a form definition later
you will always have to maintain these HTML forms in an EDIT_TEMPLATE as well. This redundancy can
be avoided by using a %<nop>RENDERFOREDIT macro that loops over all formfields in your !DataForm
to render the input form in a more dynamic way while still customizing the overall output.

| form="..." | topic name containing the !DataForm definition | form found at the base topic |
| value="..." | value to be inserted into the edit interface; makes sense for single-field calls only | stored value in the base topic |
| &lt;fieldname>_value="..." | value to be inserted into the edit interface of the named field | looks for urlparam &lt;fieldname>, defaults to stored value |
| format="..." | format string to render each formfield with, more info below | =$edit$mandatory= |
| header="..." | header string to be put in front of the output | &lt;empty string> |
| footer="..." | footer string to apped to the output | &lt;empty string> |
| mandatory="..." | string to be inserted when a field is mandatory | <span class='foswikiAlert'>**</span> |
| separator="..." | string to be put between each formatted output per formfield | &lt;empty string> |
| include="..." | regular expression fieldnames must match to be included in the output | undefined |
| exclude="..." | regular expression fieldnames must match to be excluded from the output | undefined |
| hidden="..." | those fields that match this regular expression will be rendered hidden |
| map="&lt;fieldname1>=&lt;title1>, &lt;fieldname2>=&lt;title2>, ..." | allows to map a fieldname to a different title string in the edit interface | original fieldnames are used as title string |

---+++ RENDERFORDISPLAY

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| "..." or topic="..." | name of a topic to display the form for | the base topic of the current url |
| fields="&lt;fieldname1>, &lt;fieldname2>, ..." | list of formfields to be displayed | all known formfields |
| form="..." | topic name containing the !DataForm definition | form found at the base topic |
| format="..." | format string to render each formfield with, more info below | =$edit$mandatory= |
| header="..." | header string to be put in front of the output | &lt;empty string> |
| footer="..." | footer string to apped to the output | &lt;empty string> |
| separator="..." | string to be put between each formatted output per formfield | &lt;empty string> |
| include="..." | regular expression fieldnames must match to be included in the output | undefined |
| exclude="..." | regular expression fieldnames must match to be excluded from the output | undefined |
| map="&lt;fieldname1>=&lt;title1>, &lt;fieldname2>=&lt;title2>, ..." | allows to map a fieldname to a different title string | original fieldnames are used as title string |
| labelformat="..." | format string used for labels exclusively; labels aren't real input fields; they are part of the form definition but carry read-only values only if at all  |

If all three =format=, =header= and =footer= are undefined a =foswikiFormSteps= block will be rendered as illustrated in the example below.

The =format= parameter may contain the following pseudo-variables:
   * =$attrs=: attribute string as given in the !DataForm definition
   * =$description=: formfield description in !DataForm 
   * =$edit=: the HTML form element as specified by the !DataForm definition, that is a input field, a textarea, a select box, whatever
   * =$extra=: the "extra" return value of the =Foswiki::Form::renderForEdit()= call
   * =$mandatory=: placeholder to display the =mandatory= flag when a formfield is mandatory; the format of the mandatroy flag can be defined in the =mandatory= parameter to RENDERFOREDIT
   * =$name=: the original fieldname
   * =$size=: size parameter of the formfield as given in the !DataForm definition
   * =$title=: the fieldtitle derived from the fieldname and remapped as specified in the =map= parameter
   * =$tooltip=: formfield description in !DataForm (deprecated: use =$description= instead)
   * =$type=: type of formfield as given in the !DataForm definition
   * =$values=: list of all allowed values for the formfield as defined in the !DataForm definition
